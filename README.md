This repo holds some tools to prepare Julia Evans' great 'Linux debugging
tools you'll love' zine into printable form.

The zine itself is available at http://jvns.ca/zines/#linux-debugging-tools

The procedure in this repo produces files fit for producing an A5 bound
version on lulu.com, with blank pages for notes (and to make sure the book
meets the minimum number of pages :) ).

I'm not sure the source material is of sufficient resolution for printing, so
I'm looking forward to seeing a test print arrive soon ;).
